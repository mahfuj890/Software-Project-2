 <div class="conclusion">
   <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
   <p>A Company Operating System (COS) is your company's unique way of doing things--how it operates, goes to market, produces and deals with its customers. An effective BOS transcends the people who are doing and managing the work, and is more valuable as a result. A business that effectively operates without you is always more attractive to public and private sources of capital</p>
  <p>In order to create an effective COS it is key to view your product as the business itself rather than the commodity/service you produce. This paradigm enables the leader to think of the business as a model for 100 others just like it. For example, McDonald's commodity - hamburgers and fries--are not claimed to be the best. However, McDonald's product--its business operating system--is undoubtedly one of the best.
    About the same way company management system is best and unique among them.</p>
